## âœ¨ Features

* **App Block Screen:** A minimalist and clean BlockedActivity interface designed to inform the user and help them step away from distracting apps.
* **Smart Back Button:** When the back button is pressed while on the blocking screen, only the blocking layer is dismissed, preventing the entire app from closing unexpectedly.
* **Modern Android Backend:** Built using up-to-date and stable Android libraries:
    * **AndroidX** (AppCompat, Core KTX)
    * **Material Design Components**
    * **ViewBinding** (for safe and clean view access)
    * **Navigation Component** (foundation for future screen navigation)

* [ ] **Reports & Statistics:** A visual reporting screen showing how many times blocking was triggered, time saved, etc.
* [ ] **Architectural Improvements:** Full integration of **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture to enhance sustainability and testability.
